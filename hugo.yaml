    content: |-
      I am a **Full-Stack Robotics Engineer** capable of building entire autonomous systems from scratch. 
      My strength lies in **system architecture design** (ROS2, FSM, Database) and **advanced problem solving** (Synthetic Data, Multi-robot coordination).
      
      I bridge the gap between hardware control, AI perception, and software services to create practical, working robots.
